### Gatekeeper workaround

Because the application is not signed, macOS Gatekeeper may block it.

- **Right-click** the app icon → **Open** → confirm in the dialog; or
- Run in Terminal:
  ```sh
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/WiFi\ Lens.app
  ```

## Develop

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SHIINASAMA/wifi-lens
cd wifi-lens/WiFiLens

# Build & test via SPM
swift build
swift test

# Open in Xcode for GUI development (required for app bundle with Location Services)
xed WiFiLens.xcodeproj
```
